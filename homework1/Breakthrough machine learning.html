                        Researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have
                        <br> developed a novel machine learning approach to quickly enhance the resolution of wind velocity data by 50 times
                        <br> and solar irradiance data by 25 times—an enhancement that has never been achieved before with climate data.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The researchers took an alternative approach by using adversarial training, in which the model produces physically
                        <br> realistic details by observing entire fields at a time, providing high-resolution climate data at a much faster rate.
                        <br> This approach will enable scientists to complete renewable energy studies in future climate scenarios faster and with
                        <br> more accuracy.
                        <br>

                        "To be able to enhance the spatial and temporal resolution of climate forecasts hugely impacts not only energy planning, but
                        <br> agriculture, transportation, and so much more," said Ryan King, a senior computational scientist at NREL who specializes
                        <br> in physics-informed deep learning.
                        <br>
                        <br>                        
                        King and NREL colleagues Karen Stengel, Andrew Glaws, and Dylan Hettinger authored a new article detailing their approach, titled
                        <br> "Adversarial super-resolution of climatological wind and solar data," which appears in the journal Proceedings of the National
                        <br> Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.
                        <br>
                        <br>                        
                        Accurate, high-resolution climate forecasts are important for predicting variations in wind, clouds, rain, and sea currents that fuel
                        <br> renewable energies. Short-term forecasts drive operational decision-making; medium-term weather forecasts guide scheduling and
                        <br> resource allocations; and long-term climate forecasts inform infrastructure planning and policymaking.
                        <br>
                        <br>                        
                        However, it is very difficult to preserve temporal and spatial quality in climate forecasts, according to King. The lack of high-resolution
                        <br> data for different scenarios has been a major challenge in energy resilience planning. Various machine learning techniques have
                        <br> emerged to enhance the coarse data through super resolution—the classic imaging process of sharpening a fuzzy image by adding pixels.
                        <br> But until now, no one had used adversarial training to super-resolve climate data.
                        <br>
                        <br>                        
                        "Adversarial training is the key to this breakthrough," said Glaws, an NREL postdoc who specializes in machine learning.
                        <br>Adversarial training is a way of improving the performance of neural networks by having them compete with one another
                        <br> to generate new, more realistic data. The NREL researchers trained two types of neural networks in the model—one to
                        <br> recognize physical characteristics of high-resolution solar irradiance and wind velocity data and another to insert
                        <br> those characteristics into the coarse data. Over time, the networks produce more realistic data and improve at
                        <br> distinguishing between real and fake inputs. The NREL researchers were able to add 2,500 pixels for every original pixel.
